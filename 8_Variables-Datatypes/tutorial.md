# Variables and Datatypes

- In every programming language we have Variables and Datatypes

## Variables

- Variables are just like a box or a container which stores the value given with a specified address in our memory.

### Declare and initialization of  Variables

- Unlike in C and C++, we donâ€™t declare variables by starting with their datatype.

- We can declare a variable and initialize at a same time.

    ```python
    a = 10
    ```

- The above code tells that a is holding a value of 0(zero).

Eg:

```py
print("Hey,\nhacker")
```
### Rules for declaring  Variables
- A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.

- A Python variable name cannot start with a number.

- A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).

- Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).

- The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.

## What are Datatypes ?

- Data Types determines that what kind of type of data is stored in the variables.

### Types of Datatypes

There are two types of data types
1) Primitive Types:
    - The Fundamental Data Types are called as Primitive Data Types.

    - Which not depends on other Data Types

2) Composite types:
    - These are complex data types constructed from primitive types and other composite types.

### Primitive Data Types

1. int
    - Int is a data type which stores any integer number
    ```python
    a = 10
    print(a)
    ```
    Output: 
    ```
    10
    ```
2. Float
    - Float will store the number with decimal point
    ```py
    b = 96.5
    print(b)
    ```
    output
    ```
    96.5
    ```
3. Bool
    - Bool short for Boolean can store True or False as 1, 0 respectively.
    ```py
    c = True
    print(c)
    ```
    output
    ```
    1
    ```
4. string 
    - string stores a sequence of character
    ```py
    d = 'Python'
    print(d)
    ```
    output
    ```
    Python
    ```
