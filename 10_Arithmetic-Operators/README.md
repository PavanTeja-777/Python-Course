# Arithmetic  Operators

- As in every Programming Language we have Operators. Python also supports all operators with some special operators

- The operators which are used between numbers are called as arithmetic  Operators

- The arithmetic  operators in Python are:

**Code :**
```py
print(10+3)  # Adiition
print(10-3)  # Subtraction
print(10*3)  # Multiplication
print(10/3)  # Division
print(10//3) # Floor Division - Ignores the Decimal portion (Gives Quotient)
print(10%3)  # Modulus Operator (Gives Reminder)
print(10**3) # Exponent
```
<br>

**Output :**
```
13
7
30
3.3333333333333335
3
1
1000
```

Fun Fact: 
1. Here are the numbers or which the operation taking place are called as Operands
    For eg:  
    In the above code 10 and 3 are called as operands ; +,-,8,/,//,%,** are called as operators

2. Use eval(Evaluate) function for faster and easy calculations
    ```py
    print(eval('10*3+2/8**5'))
    ```
    Output :
    ```
    36.103515625
    ```
