# Comments In Python

- For every programming language we need some statements to not execute like comments.

- Comments are basically statements that are ignored by the executer or interpreter

We write comments to 
- Leave a note
- Detail explanation of code
- Debugging

## The syntax for comments are:

1. Single line comment or full line comment:
    - By adding # before any statement it comments all line
    ```python
    # Single line comment
    print("Eg for Comments!") # a print statement which displays msg in console
    ```

2. Multi-line comment :
    - By surrounding statement(s) with triple quotes we can make it a comment
    ```python
    """
    This is a 
    multi-line
    comment
    """ 
    ```
