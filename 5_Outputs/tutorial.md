# Outputs In Python

- For every programming language we need some funtion or a statement to display the output or the calculated result.

- In Python we have print function to display the output in the console

Example for print funvtion is shown below

```python
print("Vandhe Matharam")        #Prints Vande Matharam in Console 
```
In most of the programming lanuages when we want to pass any string(Group of Letters) We sorrund them with Double Quotes("). In Python we can surround the string by Single Quote(') also.  
Here there are statemts and their respective output

**Statement 1:**
```python
print("Mera Bharath Mahan")
